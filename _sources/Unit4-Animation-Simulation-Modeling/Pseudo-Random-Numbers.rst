Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    
    As we saw in the <i>Coin Flip App</i>, App Inventor contains blocks
    that will generate random numbers and we can use those random numbers
    to simulate real-world events.
    
    But how does App Inventor create those numbers? How does a computer do
    randomness?
    
    <p>This <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/crypt/v/random-vs--pseudorandom-number-generators" target="_blank">
    Khan Academy video by Brit Cruise</a> provides a nice conceptual overview of
    <i>pseudo randomness</i> and how it differs from true randomness. The type 
    of <i>pseudo random number generator</i> described in the video is different
    from the type described in the lessons below.  But the general principles are very much the
    same.
    </p>
    

Learning Activities

    <p><h3>Computer Randomness</h3>
    <p>It is difficult for a computer to create a truly random event.
    Therefore, computers use a form of randomness known as <i><b>pseudo                                                                          
    randomness</b></i> -- that is, they <i><b>simulate</b></i> randomness.
    </p>
    <p>A pseudo random event looks random but is completely predictable -- 
    we say it is <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='deterministic'>deterministic</span> because its output can be known by someone 
    who knows how the event was programmed. What looks random to the 
    user is actually the result of a completely predictable mathematical algorithm.

    	<p>Suppose our PRNG generates the following sequence of numbers and suppose you seeded it with the value 11:</p>
    	<pre>... 14 11 5 24 2 0 17 15 8 4 ...</pre>
    	<br />
    	<p>What would be the next number after 11 generated by the PRNG?</p>
    	</pre>

    - :5: That's right! The <i>seed</i> tells the PRNG where to begin in the sequence ... 14 11 5 24 2 0 17 15 8 4 ... If the PRNG begins at 11, the next value after 11 will be 5 and then the next will be 24, and so on.

    - :21&comma;43&comma;87: Good job. Now you see how we can use a simple mathematical formula to generate a sequence of numbers. But does the sequence look random enough?

	<h3>Clock Arithmetic and the MOD operator</h3>

    <p>
    
    The <b>MOD</b> operator gives the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example, 3 MOD 2 is 1 because 3 can be divided by 2 once with a remainder of 1.  In the AP CSP exam, the a MOD b operator is defined as the remainder of a divided by b for positive numbers a and b. App Inventor also has a "Modulo of" block. In arithmetic expressions, the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='MOD operator'>MOD operator</span> has the same precedence as the * and / operators which means that MOD, *, and / are evaluated before + and - unless there are parentheses. 
    
    <p>We use <b>modulo</b> 12 arithmetic every day when we read clocks with 12 hours.

    - :/8\s*,\s*4\s*,\s*9\s*,\s*6\s*,\s*0/: Good. As you can see, this PRNG is a better model than our first try, at least in the sense the numbers in the sequence jump around more rather than always increasing.
