     <p>You are halfway through the Mobile CSP course - congratulations!</p>
     <p>At this point, your instructor may have a midterm exam for you to review concepts in Units 1-4. Strategies for reviewing include:</p>
     <ul>
        <li>Read through and/or update your portfolio entries, asking questions where you were unsure of concepts.</li>
        <li>Review the self-check exercises at the end of each lesson - ask questions if you're unsure of the correct answer.</li>
        <li>Review the apps you've created so far in the course.</li>
     </ul>

     <p>The AP CS Principles Exam does not have a designated programming language associated with it. Therefore, the Mobile CSP exams will use generic blocks. 
     A reference sheet is provided to give instructions and explanations to help you understand the format and the meaning of the questions on the exam. The reference sheet 
     can be seen&nbsp;<a></a><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mQx3cyf2dowaHmlvk0KoZXEhvF8fnXZg" style="line-height: 1.22;" target="" title="">here</a><span style="line-height: 1.22;">. It includes two programming formats: text-based and block-based. Be sure to review the reference sheet ahead of time and
     be familiar with the material that it has on it.</span></p>
