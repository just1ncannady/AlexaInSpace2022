The system was recently upgraded. Customers interacted with the original system using their phone keypad. Customers interact with the upgraded system using their voice.The upgraded system (but not the original system) stores all information from the calling session in a database for future reference. This includes the customer’s telephone number and any information provided by the customer (name, address, order number, credit card number, etc.).The original system and the upgraded system are described in the following flowcharts. Each flowchart uses the following blocks.AP 2021 Sample Question: The upgraded system uses a directory containing additional information not supplied by the customer. The directory is used to help direct calls effectively. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be included in the directory?

    There are 32 students standing in a classroom. Two different algorithms are given for findingthe average height of the students.Algorithm AStep 1: All students stand.Step 2: A randomly selected student writes his or her height on a card and is seated.Step 3: A randomly selected standing student adds his or her height to the value on the card,records the new value on the card, and is seated. The previous value on the card is erased.Step 4: Repeat step 3 until no students remain standing.Step 5: The sum on the card is divided by 32. The result is given to the teacher.Algorithm BStep 1: All students stand.Step 2: Each student is given a card. Each student writes his or her height on the card.Step 3: Standing students form random pairs at the same time. Each pair adds the numberswritten on their cards and writes the result on one student’s card; the other student isseated. The previous value on the card is erased.Step 4: Repeat step 3 until one student remains standing.Step 5: The sum on the last student’s card is divided by 32. The result is given to the teacher.Which of the following statements is true?
