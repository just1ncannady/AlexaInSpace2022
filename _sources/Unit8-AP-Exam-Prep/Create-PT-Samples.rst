		<gcb-youtube videoid="https://youtu.be/tQE3bkyaoes" instanceid="X7FYxjVROXgh"></gcb-youtube><br><p>3a.&nbsp;This program was created in MIT App Inventor to address the issue of learning new languages. Here it teaches the user how to say different colors, where the user inputs what language it wants to hear, either Spanish or French, and then taps on a color, prompting the program to output the audio for that certain color. This allows users to quickly learn how to say colors in another language through interaction and output of audio. In the video, it shows an example of the user clicking on the Spanish checkbox and playing the audio for red and blue. The user can hear what it sounds like, and thus learn how to say it correctly. If the user accidentally inputs nolanguage or both, the program will catch the error and notify the user.</p>

Since this algorithm is needed every time a user presses a button, the procedure helps the overall efficiency of the program by having the code located in one location that the program repeatedly calls on. When a user presses a certain color button, the button returns an index pertaining to the main audio list of colors. Then, the procedure takes the index of the color as a parameter and selects the respective list element, which is a string that contains the certain color. Then, depending on the language, the procedure will append a language identifier (for example, “-spanish”) and then add “.mp3”. It will then use this to call a certain color from the database of audio files that is named accordingly. The procedure is able to take parameters and inputs from the user and then output them as such by constructing certain audio file names and then pulling them from the database to play.

	<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
	<p>Remember that for managing complexity, the data abstraction must make the program easier to develop (alternatives would be more complex) or easier to maintain (future changes to the size of the list would otherwise require significant modifications to the program code). Consider how the code would change if they were adding/removing items from the list. In this particular sample, it might be difficult to understand why this sample did not earn a point for this row. The programmer of this sample would need to add more selection statements.  Here is an example of how the sample could be <i>modified</i> to meet the criteria for this row (note that this example  could be further modified so that the hard-coded index in the else statement is removed):

If the question label is equal to the second element in “question list” and the parameter “number of hours” (equal to the text box text) is 6, then the second element in “solutions list” will be displayed on “output label” and image property will be set to badd.png. In this scenario, the question asked to the user asks how many hours their AC was on during that day. The user inputs 6 to the text box, indicating that their AC was on for 6 hours. This is where I wanted a message to display to the user that they are using their AC too much and offer them alternatives. So, I created a list with solutions and that message is the second element in “solution list”, so that is why the program pulls the second element from “solution list” and displays it on “output label” when the user inputs 6 for the question at index 2 in “questions list.
	<br>Another scenario, if the first element in “question list” is equal to the string displayed in “question label” and the text input by the user, or “number of hours”, is 1, then the fourth element in “solution list” is pulled and displayed on the output label and the image is set to “good.png”. In the context of my program, this scenario would mean the question asks how long the user had spent driving on that day. The program recognizes this is the question being asked and since the parameter is less than 3, then the program will display element 4 from “solutions list” that notifies the user that they are doing a good job and that they aren’t emitting too many fossil fuels. The user will also be encouraged to keep it up and a thumbs up image will pop up.<br></p>

I had to use a random integer procedure, and I did not know which numbers to use for the comets. I had to keep using different numbers and looking at the app to make sure none of the comets ever went off the screen, and then I went between the highest and lowest numbers for both the x and the y coordinates. Another difficulty came up when I wanted to increase the speed of the comets. They were moving whenever the clock ticked, and I tried decreasing the amount of time between each tick. However, there was also a timer feature that counted down the seconds every time the clock ticked, and this was affected with the decreased intervals. To fix this, I added a second clock, and separated the timer from the comets. Both of these were independent program development.

I had to keep using different numbers and looking at the app to make sure none of the comets ever went off the screen, and then I went between the highest and lowest numbers for both the x and the y coordinates. Another difficulty came up when I wanted to increase the speed of the comets. They were moving whenever the clock ticked, and I tried decreasing the amount of time between each tick. However, there was also a timer feature that counted down the seconds every time the clock ticked, and this was affected with the decreased intervals. To fix this, I added a second clock, and separated the timer from the comets. Both of these were independent program development.</p>

	<p>While this explanation does a good job of telling what the procedure does, it waits until the last sentence to earn the point.  Giving the reader 
	     the reasons  “...makes the general coding clearer and easier to read…” effectively illustrates the managing of the complexity.  It also subtly 
	     points out how it reduces redundancy.</p>

	<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
	<p>The video and narration are well planned out and executed.  It is simple and yet thoroughly explains the app.
	     The two things to remember the difference between are purpose and function.  Purpose is the intended goal or 
	     objective of the program.  Function is how the program works.</p>

	         portions of the code until the app would finally successfully load and then reprogramming the deleted portions of code. Another difficulty
	         I encountered was transferring variables across screens in order to access the correct user’s data. Opening a new screen in App Inventor
	         would clear the values of the variable on the device, which would render them unusable on the next screen. I resolved this independently
	         by assembling the contents of each screen into its own arrangement, and utilizing the .visible property of these arrangements to make
	         them appear and disappear, providing the illusion of multiple screens and allowing the accessed variable values to be consistent across

	<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
	<p>Students should explicitly label their opportunities or difficulties as done in this example.  Adding the sentence structures “the first…”
	     and “the second…” also makes it unmistakeable for the grader to identify.  The way the student points out the resolution of the difficulties is
	     spot-on by specifically using the phrase “I resolved”.</p>

	<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
	<p>Students should take the time to explicitly describe the logical or mathematical concepts used in the design of the algorithm. This statement,
	     “redirect the program to either proceed with a login or create account procedure.” talks about the selection process, but could put more emphasis
	     on it being the logical part of the algorithm.
	Great use of the phrase “the algorithm examines” points out the function of it.  To show the relation to overall program, this example uses another 
	     great sentence structure  “...is an important algorithm as it handles...”</p>

	<h4>Additional Explanation</h4>
	<p>The statement “One of the integrated algorithms…” is a great way to call attention to the requirements for this part of the scoring criteria.  
	     When it comes to the logical/mathematical concepts, this response leaves a lot to the imagination and only states “ load up the user’s diary 
	     entries if the correct password is entered”.  By explicitly stating “My program uses logic to determine…”, one can take the guesswork out of 
	     awarding points for the grader.
	
	     This example does a nice job of explaining how both procedures do their work independently, but then also connects what they do in the 
	     conclusion.</p>
