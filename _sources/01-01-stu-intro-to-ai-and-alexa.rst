Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>In this lesson you will learn about <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">artificial intelligence (AI)</span>. Although AI has been around since the 1950s, it is widely recognized now as one of the fastest-growing fields in technology. From ELIZA to <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Alexa">Alexa</span>, AI has become something we interact with every day, and will be a part of our daily life for the foreseeable future. Navigation apps, 3D photography, facial recognition, and smart assistants are just a few of the everyday uses for AI, and you’ll be introduced to more examples. But how can we define AI? And why is the use of AI being extended into space?</p>
 
 	<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong> At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
 	<ul>
		<li>Explain how <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Alexa">Alexa</span> is an example of AI.</li>
		<li>Identify how Alexa can be used to perform basic tasks.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <p><strong>Language Objectives:</strong> At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
       <ul>
		<li>Define in writing artificial intelligence and voice AI.</li>
		<li>Orally describe the characteristics of technology that use artificial intelligence.</li>
		
       </ul>

	<h3>Exploration: What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
    <p><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</span> is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It is a process of programming a computer to make decisions for itself. This video explores the 5 big ideas associated with <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>. As you watch the video, write down ways that you can identify <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>.

	<h3>Activity: Is it AI?</h3>
	<p>In this activity, you will work with a partner or group to identify which of the examples in the next activity are <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>. Discuss the following questions as you complete the activity:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Does the example perceive/understand its environment?</li>
		<li>Does the example continue to learn?</li>
		<li>Does the example make plans or decisions on its own?</li>
		<li>Does the example interact with its environment?</li>
		<li>Who is doing the thinking? Where is the intelligence - with the humans who programmed it or with the device/program?</li>

			:answer_b: No
			:answer_c: It Depends
			:feedback_a: It depends. If the automatic door using was using facial recognition to operate, it would be an example of AI. If it is just using a sensor to determine if something is there or not, then it would not be an example of AI.
			:feedback_b: It depends. If the automatic door using was using facial recognition to operate, it would be an example of AI. If it is just using a sensor to determine if something is there or not, then it would not be an example of AI.

			:feedback_a: It depends. The thinking is happening with the person who is controlling the drone, so that part is not AI. However, if the drone can recognize objects or sense when it is close to something and decide to move in a specific direction, then that part is AI.
			:feedback_b: It depends. The thinking is happening with the person who is controlling the drone, so that part is not AI. However, if the drone can recognize objects or sense when it is close to something and decide to move in a specific direction, then that part is AI.

	<h3>Discussion: Alexas as AI</h3>
	<p>So far in this lesson, you have defined <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">artificial intelligence</span> and explored examples of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>. Sometimes, an <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> technology will incorporate other <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> systems or technologies to function. In this video, you will explore how speech recognition functions in conjunction with other <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> technologies. As you watch the video, write down reasons that Amazon <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Alexa">Alexa</span> devices are considered to be <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>.

	<h3>New Words: Wake Words, Intents, and Utterances</h3>
	
	<p>Alexa uses <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span> to build on preprogrammed skills, speech recognition, and speech synthesis to interact with humans to improve productivity. In the next lesson, you will begin exploring how you will be able to build your own <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Alexa">Alexa</span> skill. This video introduces some words that will be necessary to begin building your skill. As you watch the video, listen for the terms wake word, intent, and utterance.</p>
