Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>In this lesson you will learn about <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">artificial intelligence (AI)</span>. Although AI has been around since the 1950s, it is widely recognized now as one of the fastest-growing fields in technology. From ELIZA to <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Alexa">Alexa</span>, AI has become something we interact with every day, and will be a part of our daily life for the foreseeable future. Navigation apps, 3D photography, facial recognition, and smart assistants are just a few of the everyday uses for AI, and you’ll be introduced to more examples. But how can we define AI? And why is the use of AI being extended into space?</p>
 
 	<p><strong>Learning Goals:</strong> At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
 	<ul>
		<li>Explain how <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="Alexa">Alexa</span> is an example of AI.</li>
		<li>Identify how Alexa can be used to perform basic tasks.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <p><strong>Language Goals:</strong> At the end of this lesson, you will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>Define in writing artificial intelligence and voice AI.</li>
		<li>Orally describe the characteristics of technology that use artificial intelligence.</li>
    </ul>

	<h3>Activity: Is it AI?</h3>
	<p>In this activity, you will work with a partner or group to identify which of the examples in the next activity are <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="artificial intelligence (AI)">AI</span>. Discuss the following questions as you complete the activity:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Does the example perceive/understand its environment?</li>
		<li>Does the example continue to learn?</li>
		<li>Does the example make plans or decisions on its own?</li>
		<li>Does the example interact with its environment?</li>
		<li>Who is doing the thinking? Where is the intelligence - with the humans who programmed it or with the device/program?</li>
