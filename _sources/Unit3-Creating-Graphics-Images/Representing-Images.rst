    <ul><li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Fewer bits does not necessarily mean less information.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The amount of size reduction from compression depends on both the amount of redundancy in the original data representation and the compression algorithm applied.</li><li>The amount of compression can vary depending on how many bits are used to represent each <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='pixel'>pixel</span> in the image. </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">The amount of compression also depends on the number of different colors used in the actual image.  For our black and white spaceship there were only 2 colors, so there were relatively few color changes and therefore lots of long runs. If it were a colored spaceship, there would be many color changes and therefore fewer long runs. So we would get much less compression. </li>

    <h3>Other Activities</h3>
    <p>Your teacher may ask you to do some of the following activities in POGIL teams or pairs.
    </p><ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
    American Standard Code for Information Interchange (<span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='ASCII'>ASCII</span>) is character code that includes 128 characters.
    Write your own message in binary that someone else could decode using an <a href="http://sticksandstones.kstrom.com/appen.html" target="_blank"><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='ASCII'>ASCII</span> to Binary table</a>. Trade messages in class and decode each others.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"> 
    In web pages and in App Inventor, colors are represented using hexcode for Red, Green, and Blue values.
    Here’s <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_mixer.asp" target="_blank" title="">a color mixer app</a> 
    that lets you explore the different colors that are used in Web pages.  You can also try making a Custom Color in App Inventor by changing the Screen's BackgroundColor property to Custom. How many bits are used to 
    represent the colors in Hex Code?   Figure out  the Hex code for pure red?  pure green? pure blue?
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Research another image type (e.g. 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Interchange_Format" target="_blank">GIF</a>, 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics" target="_blank">PNG</a>, 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format" target="_blank">BMP</a>, 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIFF" target="_blank">TIFF</a>, etc.) 
    and compare and contrast the data needed to 
    store information about the images. Include what type of compression is used. 
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">If you have a digital camera or a smartphone or tablet, find out what image representation scheme 
    it uses?  How come all images are not the same size?
    </li>
    <li><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='ASCII'>ASCII</span> is one type of character code, but 128 characters is not enough for today’s computers, 
      which can represent Chinese, Hindi, and scripts from many other languages.  Today’s computers 
      use a system called Unicode, which has more than 100,000 different characters and covers 
      more than 100 different scripts (languages).  Use this 
    <a href="http://pages.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/resources/unicodemaker.html" target="_blank">Unicode converter</a> to convert these Chinese characters to their hexadecimal Unicode values and to 
      their corresponding decimal values:  国话.  Convert these Greek letters: οι.  Convert these 
      Russian letters: Я ю.

    <p><b>How do Snapchat filters work?</b>
    <br/>
    If you or someone you know uses the social media app Snapchat, they have probably used one of those cool filters. But, how exactly do those filters work? Watch the video below to learn more about the algorithm and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='pixel'>pixel</span> data behind Snapchat filters.

    <p><b>How does JPEG encoding work?</b> <br/>JPEG is an example of a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='lossy compression'>lossy compression</span> algorithm.  JPEG, 
      which uses the file extension .jpg or .jpeg, is the most common format used today to represent images.The JPEG algorithm was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), hence its name.  The fact that JPEG is a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='lossy compression'>lossy</span> technique means that some of the information present 
      in the image is lost during compression and cannot be recovered. Here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKxlrWcvyJs" target="_blank">video lecture on the JPEG compression algorithm</a> (<a href="http://www.teachertube.com/video/mobile-csp-jpeg-lossy-compression-438227" target="_blank" title="">Teacher Tube version</a>). The compression
      algorithm involves some math, but the video describes just enough of the math so 
      that you can see how JPEG works. The video is a summary of an excellent, more detailed 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2odrCGjOFY" target="_blank">presentation by Randell Heyman</a> -- you should really
      check out the Heyman video if you are interested in more of the mathematical details.

    <p><b>How are audio files digitized?</b>
    <br/>
    What about audio files? How are they digitized and converted to bits? Watch the following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALFXrlrnAcI" target="_blank">video</a> for a summary of how audio files are converted from <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='analog'>analog</span> to digital format. <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='analog'>Analog</span> refers to data with values that change continuously, or smoothly, over time, like sound or music files.  
    <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='analog'>Analog</span> data is converted to a digital forms, 0s and 1s in binary, using a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sampling'>sampling</span> technique, which means measuring values of the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='analog'>analog</span> signal at regular intervals (usually in time or space) called samples. The samples are measured to figure out the exact bits required to store each sample. The use of digital data to approximate real-world <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='analog'>analog</span> data is a great example of abstraction!

      Here's a fun activity if you have a computer or tablet with a microphone. Go to <a href="https://academo.org/demos/virtual-oscilloscope/" target="_blank">https://academo.org/demos/virtual-oscilloscope/</a> or a different audio recorder and see the sound waves that your voice can produce. Think about how they would be represented in 0s and 1s.</p><p>
    
    Different audio file extensions compress the audio data in different ways. WAV files are huge because they just store snapshots of digitized values at different points of time with no compression. MP3 formatting compresses audio files by removing parts of the audio signal which the human ear cannot easily hear. They save on space while preserving good audio quality.
