Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <p>In this lesson, you will work with a partner to identify and analyze a large data set that interests both of you. This project requires developing several questions, or hypotheses, about the data and then investigating them by creating visualizations to answer those questions. As you complete your project, keep track of your process on your portfolio using the reflection questions as a guide.
    </p>

Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p><h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Work collaboratively to research, investigate and analyze a large data set making sure that your project meets the following specifications.
         <ol type="a">
    <li><b>Data Sources:</b> For this project, your large data set must contain at least 1,000 data values or cells. (You may use one of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13qhmWAlwmUVWZQei5DJazUlYLyrWVHprRrfghWpv6_E/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">these data sources</a>, but you are encouraged to find others!)</li>
    <li><b>Questions &amp; Hypotheses:</b> Brainstorm with your partner 3-5 questions and corresponding hypotheses that you believe can be answered using your chosen data set. <br/>First, write a question you have about the data set you chose. <br/>Now, convert that question into a hypothesis (a statement) with your prediction about the data. <br/>Hypotheses take the form of "If __________, then _________." <br/>For example, a hypothesis about student debt data could be, "If the tuition costs are higher at an institution, the student debt will be higher."</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Download the data and put it into a Google Sheet. Record where you found the data set and when you downloaded it so you can cite it in your portfolio write-up.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Work collaboratively and use the tools available on the Google Spreadsheets and/or Google My Maps to determine if your 3-5 hypotheses are supported or refuted.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Create your own data visualizations that illustrate your hypotheses using Google Sheets and/or Google My Maps (do not use any existing visualizations that may have accompanied your data set, but create your own). 
      <ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha;">
    <li>If you need a refresher on different types of graphs and when to use them, this short <a href="http://www.mathgoodies.com/lessons/graphs/compare_graphs.html" target="_blank" title="">tutorial from MathGoodies</a> may be helpful, as well as this reference to <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/190718" target="_blank">different types of charts available in Google Sheets</a>.</li>
    <li>For each chart, make sure it includes a title and has the appropriate values labeled on its axes.  </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Complete the portfolio reflection questions below.</li>
    <li><i>(Optional) Give a 5-10 minute oral presentation with visuals (a PowerPoint with charts, graphs, etc.) Your presentations should follow the same structure as your portfolio write-up.</i></li>
    </ol>

Reflection: For Your Portfolio

    <p><div class="yui-wk-div" id="portfolio">
    <p>Answer the following portfolio reflection questions as directed by your instructor. Questions are also available in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w6ZPBCPHjyWIHJ9ybtsx314pGAmd_ttiAIFRhmYXQDo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" title="">Google Doc</a> where you may use File/Make a Copy to make your own editable copy.</p>

    <!--
      &lt;p&gt;Create a page named &lt;i&gt;Data Visualization Project&lt;/i&gt; in your portfolio and answer the following questions.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Which data set did you select and why did you choose it? Summarize the data included, being specific about the types of data (text, sounds, transactions, etc.) included. Make sure you list the title and the website where you found the data.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;List your 3-5 hypotheses and the data visualizations that you created for each. (Include the visualizations as images on your portfolio or provide a link to them shared with your instructor.)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Explain how collaborating with a partner helped you gain new insight or knowledge about the data.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Identify at least one security and/or privacy concern that is associated with the data in the data set you chose.&lt;/li&gt;
