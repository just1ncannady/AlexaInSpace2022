ASSESSMENT: Non-AP Create 2
============================

.. raw:: html

	
	
	<h3 id="est-length">Time Estimate: 12 hours (some combination of in-class and out of class time) minimum</h3>
	
	<p>Follow these directions if you are taking a Non-AP CSP course. If you are taking CSP as an AP course, please go to the previous lesson for the AP Create directions.</p>

Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

	<p>Work with a partner to design a socially useful interactive app, that  demonstrates algorithms such as selection and repetition and data and procedural abstractions. As you develop your project keep track of significant errors and bugs that you encountered and how you solved or debugged them in a journal.</p>
	
	<p>Please review non-AP instructions and rubric below:

	<h3>Iterative Design Thinking Process</h3>
	<p>Use an Iterative Design Thinking Process to develop your app:<br>
	   </p><table style="width: 80%;" border="0">
	      <tbody>
	        <tr>
	          <td><b>Iterations</b><br>
	            <ul>
	              <li>Iteration 1: Paper Prototype (~2 hours)</li>
				<li>Iteration 2: Minimal App (~3 hours)</li>
				<li>Iteration 3: Intermediate App (~3 hours)</li>
				<li>Iteration 4: Enhanced App (~3 hours)</li>
	              <li>Iteration 5 and on: Additional Features</li>
	            </ul>
	          </td>
	          <td><img src="../_static/assets/img/DesignThinkingimage.png?" class="yui-img" title="Design Thinking" alt="Design Thinking" style="width: 250px;"><br>
	          </td></tr></tbody></table>
	
	
	<p>For the Non-AP version of the Create Task, we recommend that you work with a partner using pair or buddy programming to create a socially-useful app. With your partner, follow the iterative development process in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zbHDdR-l5JF9xGor-hChrqB8pzCnxgxwMY-vBCZqJYI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> Create  Task  with Design Thinking</a>. Here is what you need to turn in at each iteration.
	</p>
	
	  <h3>Iteration 1: Paper Prototype</h3>
	  <p>
	Before you start creating the app in App Inventor, you will brainstorm ideas on paper with a partner and present an elevator pitch to your class. Turn in the following:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description of Problem </span><span style="font-weight: 700;">[Empathize, Define, and Ideate]</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">:</span> Working in pairs,  think about problems in your community and how an app might help to solve those problems or to help people in your community. Who is the target audience or users who will be using the app? What problem does the app address? How does the app address the problem?
	  </li>
	  <li><b>Paper Prototypes [Prototype]: </b> Create <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1M-DZITeDT9aiPZ7Oz-kXKEGkn0DiFOH1i8idBNlxwCA/edit" target="_blank">paper prototypes</a> of three different brainstorm ideas. Describe what each UI element will do.</li>
	  
	  <li><b>Elevator Pitch:</b> Present a short (2-3 minute) elevator pitch of your project idea to the class.  The pitch could follow this template: <br>
	      <b><i>[name of app] is a [kind of thing] for [the people who would use it or problem it would solve] that, unlike [similar apps] is able to [the major distinguishing feature of your app].</i></b></li>
	  <li><b>Feedback [Test]: </b>Other students should provide feedback answering the following questions. Is the app presented socially useful why or why not? What is a strength of the proposed app? What suggestions do you have to improve the app? </li>
	</ul>
	  
	
	<h3>Iteration 2: Minimal App</h3>
	<p>Working in pairs, create a minimal working app. Turn in the following:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><b>Minimal app [Prototype and Test]</b>: Build an initial prototype with minimal functions for your app with your partner. </li>
	 <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Journal [Define and Ideate]:&nbsp;</b>As you work, keep a journal of your development process and problems encountered and how you solved them. Complete a journal entry using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mYjhGMo8wQzo101bD2Ebvp7ua__8qGQy_BZkT9jq_sw/copy" target="_blank" title="">journal entry template</a>.</span></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Iteration 3: Intermediate </h3>
	<p>
	<ul>
	 
	  <li><b>Intermediate App&nbsp;</b><b>[Prototype and Test]</b>: Iteratively add and test new features for your app, meeting the grading guidelines. For the Create 2 project, your project should use a List or a database like TinyDB for handling data, as well as procedures that you have defined, preferably with parameters, and if or loop blocks. 
	   <ul>
	         <li><i>Documentation of Code:</i> For this assignment, a well documented app means having well named components, variables, and procedures. Where appropriate, your code should contain comments that explains the various parts of your code.</li>
	         <li><i>Data:</i> For this assignment, your app should make appropriate use of variables and  lists. If data persistence is necessary for your app, you should make use of a database such as TinyDB or CloudDB.</li>
	         <li><i>Algorithms: </i>For this assignment, your app should make appropriate use of sequence, selection, and repetition control structures including math and/or logic (in if or loop blocks) operations.</li>
	         <li><i>Abstraction:</i> For this assignment, your app should make appropriate use of one or more programmer defined procedures to handle certain subtasks. Also, your procedures should use parameters where appropriate.</li>
	     
	      </ul></li>
	 <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Journal&nbsp;<b>[Define and Ideate]</b>:</b> Keep a journal of your development process and problems encountered and how you solved them. Complete a journal entry using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mYjhGMo8wQzo101bD2Ebvp7ua__8qGQy_BZkT9jq_sw/copy" target="_blank" title="">journal entry template</a>.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Iteration 4: Advanced App </h3>
	<p>
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Advanced App [Prototype, Test]:&nbsp;</b>Iteratively add and test new features for your app, meeting the grading guidelines. 
	</span></li>
	 <li><b>Journal&nbsp;<b>[Define and Ideate]</b>:</b> Keep a journal of your development process and problems encountered and how you solved them.

	</ul>
	
	<h3>Iteration 5: Additional Features </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Additional Features [Prototype, Test]:&nbsp;</b>Iteratively add and test new features for your app.
	</span></li>
	  <li><span class="yui-non"><b>Journal&nbsp;<b>[Define and Ideate]</b>:</b> Keep a journal of your development process and problems encountered and how you solved them.
