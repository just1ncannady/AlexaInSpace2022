    <td>The Quiz App presents a quiz about pioneers in computer science.The quiz uses lists, labels, images, and a button to create a simple question and answer quiz that displays ‘Correct!’ or ‘Incorrect!’ depending on the user’s answer. An index variable is used to keep track of the current question and access its  correct answer and corresponding image. The questions, answers, and corresponding images are in <b>parallel lists</b> where the first question in the question list matches with the first answer in the answer list and the first picture in the picture list, etc.
    
          
            <p><b>Objectives:</b> In this lesson you will learn to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>navigate through a list using an index variable;</li>
    <li>select items from a list;</li>
    <li>check for the end of the list;</li>
    <li>work with parallel lists.</li>

    <p><h3>Video Tutorial</h3>
    <p>
      To get started, open App Inventor with the 
      <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?repo=templates.appinventor.mit.edu/trincoll/csp/unit6/templates/QuizApp/QuizAppTemplate.asc" target="_blank">Quiz App template</a> 
      in a separate tab and follow along with the following video tutorials or the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RPxUXIbluNl4RBjEsBojSzQTvBZqWm3eO5Y9Fci_-0k/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">text tutorial</a> or for an extra challenge use just the  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1esBQ08ydu6a-ZpNjQ9FPk-qMuHmg6gjSRtnLPaOLo60/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">short handout</a>.

    <h3>Quiz Questions</h3>
    <p>The template contains the images used in this quiz, however you will be typing in the quiz questions and answers:
      
    <br/>The questions are:
    </p><ol>
    <li>Which computer science pioneer broke the German Enigma Code during the World War II?
      </li>
    <li>Which recent movie showcases the first African-American women who worked as human “computers” for NASA?
      </li>
    <li>Which Navy admiral led the creation of COBOL, one of the first high level programming languages?
      </li>
    </ol>
    The matching answers are:
    <ol>
    <li>Alan Turing</li>
    <li>Hidden Figures</li>
    <li>Grace Hopper</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the app you will construct separate lists for the questions and answers (and picture files) in which
      the first question in the question list goes with the first answer in answer list.  This is known as a 
      <b><i>parallel list construction</i></b>.  This parallel setup allows you to easily keep track of questions, 
      their answers, and their pictures using an <i><b>index</b></i> variable. 
    
    
    </p><h3>Enhancements and Extensions</h3>
    <p>Here are some programming problems that will let you enhance and extend the Quiz App. 
      </p><ol>
    <li>As you might have noticed, if the answer is “Alan Turing” and the user types in “alan turing”, 
          the answer will be marked incorrect.  That’s not very nice for the user.  To remedy this 
          problem you will want to convert both the user’s answer and the stored answer to upper case 
          “ALAN TURING”.  (HINT: use the <b><i>upcase block</i></b> in the Text drawer to convert both strings.)
        </li>
    <li>When the user gets an incorrect answer, instead of just reporting “incorrect”, use a join 
          block to also display the correct answer.  “Sorry, that is incorrect. The correct answer is Grace Hopper.” 
        </li>
    <li>  Add <i>RandomButton</i> to the app that when clicked will display a random 
          question from the quiz.  (HINT:  You could use some new blocks from the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/support/blocks/lists.html#pickrandomitem" target="_blank">List drawer</a> such as a <em>pick a random  item</em> block fed into a <em>index in list thing</em> block to set the index randomly.)
        </li>
    <li>Add a fourth question (and answer and picture) to the quiz.  If you like, you can research 
          "famous computer scientists" on the Web to discover a fourth person.  Or, if you wish, you can 
          create a question about <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2011/abelson-sigcse-award" target="_blank">Hal Abelson</a>, 
          the creator of our App Inventor programming language. (HINT: You should only have to modify the 3 lists 
          and upload an image file. The code should work with any number of questions as long as you used 
          the length of list block instead of hard coding in the number 3 for the number of questions.)
        </li>
    </ol>

    :answer_b: The displayName procedure is not being called when the button is clicked.
    :feedback_b: That's right. Although displayName is defined correctly, it was never being called in Button1.Click. Here's the corrected code:<br><img src="assets/img/buttonClickDisplayNameProcedureCorrected.png" class="yui-img"><br>
    :answer_c: The displayName procedure has a bug in it. 
    :feedback_c: Let me add new information to help you solve this; the displayName procedure is defined correctly and does not contain any bugs.
    :answer_d: The displayName procedure was never defined. 
    :feedback_d: Let me add new information to help you solve this; the displayName procedure is defined as set Label1.Text to the item at index X of the names list.
    :answer_e: Maybe Label1 is not enabled. 
    :feedback_e: Let me add new information to help you solve this; labels do not have an enabled property or feature. Labels are used just to display text.
    :correct: b

    Find the bug. When Button1 is clicked, Label1 is supposed to be set to a name that is selectedfrom the names list by the displayName procedure. But the label's Text never changes. Why?

    :answer_b: The app will stop running and an error message will appear.
    :feedback_b: If it were easy, you wouldn’t be learning anything! This is not an issue as the index never gets too big so the select list item always selects a valid item.
    :answer_c: The last question in the quiz will never be reached.
    :feedback_c: Because of the ">=" in the if-test, the quiz jumps to the first question before the last is displayed. Replacing ">=" with ">" would provide the correct behavior.

    The following blocks specify what happens when the user clicks "Next" in a quiz app:There is a subtle error in the code such that the quiz won't work as desired. What is the problem?
