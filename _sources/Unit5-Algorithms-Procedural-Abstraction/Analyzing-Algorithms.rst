    <td><b><i>Searching and Sorting Experiments.</i></b>
    In this lesson we are going to use an App Inventor app to experiment with and
    analyze the algorithms we have been studying.  You will be running two different
    apps, one to test the search algorithms and one to test the sorting algorithms.
    
    <p>This activity will resemble that of a scientific investigation.  You'll run the 
    apps repeatedly on different lists of data, record the running times of the algorithms,
    tabulate and graph your data, and then analyze the results.  Can you figure out from
    the results, which algorithm is which?
    
    </p><p>Another way to look at this activity is as <i>quality assurance (QA)</i>.  Many
    careers in the computing field start with assignments in QA.  This is where you help
    software developers test and debug their apps. 
    
    </p><p><b>Objectives:</b> In this lesson you will learn to :
    </p><ul>
    <li>conduct an empirical (experimental) investigation of basic search and sort 
    algorithms;
    </li><li>determine the efficiency (how fast they run) for basic search and sort algorithms depending on input size;
    </li><li>deepen your understanding of basic search and sort algorithms.

    :feedback_a: No, try again. Pretend you are trying to guess a number from 1-15 using binary search. Always guess the middle element and see if it is higher or lower than your correct number 14. See how many times you need to guess.&nbsp;
    :answer_b: 3
    :feedback_b: Yes, the first time through the loop, 14 is compared with the middle element 8 and is higher, so you narrow down to items 9-15. Then, 14 is compared with 12, the middle element of the 9-15 range, and you narrow down to 13-15. Then, 14 is compared to 14 and you find the element in 3 iterations.&nbsp;
    :answer_c: 4
    :feedback_c: This is the worst case runtime if the item was the last one you checked or was not on the list, but we can find the number 14 quicker. Pretend you are trying to guess a number from 1-15 using binary search. Always guess the middle element and see if it is higher or lower than your correct number 14. See how many times you need to guess.&nbsp;
    :answer_d: 14
    :feedback_d: This would be true if you were using linear search, but you are using binary search here and can find 14 quicker!
    :correct: b

    If you were using binary search to find the number 14 in the following list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15], how many iterations would be required to find 14 in the list?

    For a list of 500 numbers, at most how many iterations would the loop in binary search run to find a number? For example, if this was a guessing game, at most how many guesses would it take using binary search to guess a secret number from 1-500, if after each guess you were told whether your guess was too high or too low or just right? Type your answer into the text box.  |blank|

    - :9: That's right! It would take at most 9 guesses because 2^9 equals 512, which is greater than 500. So you can divide the range 1 to 500 in half at most 9 times before running out of numbers.
      :x: 500 numbers would take at most 9 guesses.  That's because you can divide that range of numbers 9 times before getting down to 1 number.  For example, if we use whole number division and round up, we would get: 250, 125, 63, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

    :answer_b: Binary search
    :feedback_b: That's right! Binary search behaves like the logarithm function. That is, as the number of elements to be search grows bigger, the number of lookups required to find an element grows too, but grows very slowly. That is what makes binary search a very efficient algorithm.

    :answer_a: how many comparisons are needed to sort the values. 
    :feedback_a: This is challenging, but rewarding! Remember that not all sorting algorithms involve comparisons of values.  For example, in bucket sort it is not necessary to compare items to each other in order to sort a list.  A nice analogy for bucket sort is the task of sorting laundry.  When you come to a T-shirt in the unsorted pile, you don't need to compare it to other items in the unsorted pile in order to place it into T-shirt pile. 
    :answer_b: whether the algorithm correctly arranges the values in order. 
    :feedback_b: This is challenging, but rewarding! Not all algorithms involve arranging values in order, for example, the bucket sort does not involve comparing or swapping to put values in order.
    :answer_c: whether or not the algorithm contains a bug. 
    :feedback_c: This is challenging, but rewarding! The efficiency of an algorithm does not focus on whether the algorithm contains a bug. 
    :answer_d: how long it takes to arrange the values in order. 
    :feedback_d: That's right! Efficiency in terms of sorting means how long the algorithm takes. Remember that not all sorting algorithms involve comparisons of values. And not all sort algorithms involve swapping values. Although bubble sort involves both comparing and swapping elements, bucket sort is an algorithm that involves neither comparing nor swapping.  A nice analogy for bucket sort is the task of sorting laundry.  When you come to a T-shirt in the unsorted pile, you don't need to compare it to other items in the unsorted pile in order to place it into T-shirt pile. 
    :answer_e: how many swaps are needed to sort the values. 
    :feedback_e: This is challenging, but rewarding! Not all sort algorithms involve swapping values.  For example, bubble sort does involve swapping values but the merge sort that we studied does not involve swapping.

    :answer_b: as the size of the list grows, bucket sort will be faster than bubble sort. 
    :feedback_b: That's right! Bucket sort is the more efficient algorithm in the sense that as the size of the list grows, the time it takes to sort the values will not increase as fast as for bubble sort. Bubble sort may actually be faster for very small list. Remember the number of comparisons and swaps cannot be used here because bucket sort does not compare values in the way the bubble sort does.

    :answer_a: A comparison-based algorithm. 
    :feedback_a: True. Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm, meaning that it is based on comparing pairs of values.
    :answer_b: Useful only for sorting numbers. 
    :feedback_b: Of course it’s tough – school is here to makes our brains stronger! A bubble sort can also be used to sort items other than numbers, including cards and money.
    :answer_c: An N<sup>2</sup> algorithm. 
    :feedback_c: True. Bubble sort is a quadratic algorithm, which means that the amount of time it takes to sort a data set grows like a quadratic (x2) curve as the number of items to be sorted grows. 
    :answer_d: More efficient than bucket sort. 
    :feedback_d: Of course it’s tough – school is here to makes our brains stronger! This isn't always true. Depending on the number of items being sorted, the bucket sort may actually be faster.
    :answer_e: Widely used to sort large data sets. 
    :feedback_e: Of course it’s tough – school is here to makes our brains stronger! For sorting large data sets, a bucket sort is faster and therefore more widely used for sorting large data sets.

    :answer_a: A comparison-based algorithm. 
    :feedback_a: This will be a challenging concept to learn, but we can all reach this goal. A bucket sort  is not a comparison-based sorting algorithm because it does not compare pairs of values. A nice analogy for bucket sort is the task of sorting laundry.  When you pick up a T-shirt from the unsorted pile, you don't need to compare it with other items from the unsorted pile in order to place it into the T-shirt pile. 
    :answer_b: Useful only for sorting numbers. 
    :feedback_b: This will be a challenging concept to learn, but we can all reach this goal. A bucket sort can be used to sort many items, including laundry and groceries.
    :answer_c: An N<sup>2</sup> algorithm. 
    :feedback_c: This will be a challenging concept to learn, but we can all reach this goal. The bucket sort is not a quadratic algorithm. The time it takes to do a bucket sort does not grow like a quadratic (x2) curve as the number of items to be sorted grows. 
    :answer_d: More efficient than bubble sort. 
    :feedback_d: True. Most often, unless you are sorting a really small set of items, a bucket sort is more efficient than a bubble sort.
    :answer_e: A linear algorithm 
    :feedback_e: True. Bucket sort is a linear algorithm, which means that the amount of time it takes to sort a data set grows like a linear (x) curve as the number of items to be sorted grows.

    <!--&lt;p&gt;Create a page named &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Analyzing Algorithms&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; under the &lt;i&gt;Reflections&lt;/i&gt; 
      category of your portfolio and answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ol&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;
         Present the results and the analysis you did for each of the experiments in this lesson, 
         -- i.e., the table of running times you observed, the graphs you created, and the conclusions 
         you reached regarding the searching algorithms and sorting algorithms. Provide a clear description, 
         referring to your graphs and your tabulated data, to explain how you arrived at your conclusions.
      &lt;/li&gt;
         
         &lt;!--  RM: DELETED, College Board will not require this kind of analysis. 
         Consider the following App Inventor block, which implements an algorithm to
    find the largest factor of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. A factor of N would be a number that evenly divides
    N.  For example, the largest factor of 22 would be 11 and the largest factor of 100 would
    be 50.  The largest factor of 17 would be 1 because 17 is a prime number -- i.e., only 
    divisible by 1. 
    
    &lt;br&gt;Analyze this algorithm&#39;s run time efficiency.  Is it &lt;i&gt;logarithmic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;linear&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N log N&lt;/i&gt;, or &lt;i&gt;quadratic&lt;/i&gt;? 
    &lt;br&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;assets/img/LargestFactorAlgorithm.png&quot; width=&quot;400&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Examine the 
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/quick-sort&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;
    Quick Sort visualization&lt;/a&gt;. Do you think quick sort has a similar efficiency to 
    bubble, merge, or bucket sort? Why? Which of the scenarios presented 
    (random, nearly sorted, reversed, few unique) is closest to a worst 
    case scenario for merege sort?
    &lt;/li&gt;
    
    &lt;/ol&gt;-->
