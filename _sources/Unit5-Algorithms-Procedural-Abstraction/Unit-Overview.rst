    &lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been using the term &lt;i&gt;algorithm&lt;/i&gt; from the beginning without explaining
    it.  And you&#39;ve seen several examples of algorithms. So you probably have some ideas
    about algorithms.  But its time for a closer look.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;h3&gt;Unit Features&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Programming: The Logo apps introduce the idea of procedures - named blocks of code 
    that perform a specific task. They are based on one of the very first educational programming languages.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;CS Principles: Algorithms are examined within the context of procedures as well as looking at common algorithms for searching and sorting. How to analyze and compare an algorithm&#39;s <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='efficiency'>efficiency</span>is also introduced.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    <!--Below is the &quot;studentized&quot; version of the overview from the official syllabus-->
    <p class="overview">
      This unit examines algorithms and procedures in more detail. The Logo apps, started in Unit 4 and continued in Unit 5, introduce the concept of <b>procedural abstraction </b>and you will learn to define and use procedures -- named blocks of code that perform a specific task -- as well as when and how to use <b>procedures with parameters</b>. By encapsulating the algorithms into named procedures and introducing <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='parameters'>parameters</span> to help generalize the algorithms, you will be able to see the advantages of procedural abstraction. In addition to designing and testing your own algorithms,  you will be introduced to the <b>analysis of algorithms</b>. You will compare various <b>searching</b> and <b>sorting</b> algorithms, including examining the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='efficiency'>efficiency</span> of each. For the searching and sorting algorithms, you will analyze them both experimentally and through mathematical concepts such as functions and graph. The impact section of this unit provides another opportunity for you to explore a computing innovation and the effects it has on society.</p>

    &lt;ul&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;background&lt;/b&gt;: multitasking computers are capable of executing several tasks, or programs, at the same time&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;binary&lt;/b&gt;: pertaining to a number system that has just two unique digits&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;bot&lt;/b&gt;: short for robot, a computer program that runs automatically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;cache&lt;/b&gt;: a special high-speed storage mechanism&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;firewall&lt;/b&gt;: a part of a computer system or network that is designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from that network&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;foreground&lt;/b&gt;: in multiprocessing systems, the process that is currently accepting input from the keyboard or other input device&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt;: hypertext markup language, a standardized system for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on World Wide Web pages&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
       &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;URL&lt;/b&gt;: (uniform resource locator) it is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
