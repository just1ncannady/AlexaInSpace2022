    <h3>Activities: Decimal and Binary Odometers</h3> 
    
    Your teacher may choose to have you do some or all of the activities below:
    <ol>
    <li> Your class can act out the video above by printing and using the following <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1okQhwTYVLcXN13QioAH71VUhw5e88vxYZ4sVXvSPANY/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Binary Dot Cards</a>. Have 5 students volunteer to hold the 5 cards at the front of the class. Have them flip the cards randomly and see if the class can figure out the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='binary number system'>binary</span> and the corresponding decimal number they make by counting the dots. See if the 5 volunteers can count up from 0 to 11111.   What's the largest number that you can make with the 5 <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='binary number system'>binary</span> digits? You may want to return to this activity when you get to the converting <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='binary number system'>binary</span> to decimal and converting decimal to <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='binary number system'>binary</span> sections below.</li>
    <li>As you saw in the video, the children together were simulating a <b>binary odometer</b> to count in <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='base'>base</span> 2. Humans  use the <b>decimal</b> number system, counting in <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='base'>base</span> 10, probably because we have 10 fingers, but computer circuits only have 2 states, on and off, and so use the binary (<span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='base'>base</span> 2) number system. A binary odometer is similar to a decimal (<span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='base'>base</span> 10) odometer, like the one we have in our
    cars, except it only has two digits.  And the rightmost digit is the <b>1s</b> place.  The
    digit to its left is the <b>2s</b> place and then comes the <b>4s</b> place and so on.   
    
    <p>To try this yourself, use a piece of paper or the first table in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10aNql-sT9f8-mKXAEBwA6vhpseB6WIzskWYFiRQYXy0/copy" target="_blank">binary/hex worksheet</a> and the odometer approach to write out the values of the first 16 binary numbers. Remember you can only use 0's and 1's. <b>HINT: </b>  You'll need 4 digits (<span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bits</span>) to represent the numbers 0 through 15 in binary, so write the value 0 as  0000.  If you get stuck or to check your answer, use this binary odometer app for
    help or to check your answer:<br/>

    :random:
    :practice: T
    :answer_a: 5
    :feedback_a: This will be a challenging concept to learn, but we can all reach this goal. The number 8 in binary is represented as 1000.  Additional numbers can be represented by turning some of the 0s into 1s.  For example, the number 9 would be represented as 1001. 
    :answer_b: 12
    :feedback_b: This will be a challenging concept to learn, but we can all reach this goal. The number 12 in binary is represented as 1100.  Additional numbers can be represented by turning some of the 0s into 1s.  For example, the number 13 would be represented as 1101.
    :answer_c: 15
    :feedback_c: Yes. The largest number that can be represented in 4 bits would be 1111, which is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8, which equals 15. 
    :answer_d: 16
    :feedback_d: This will be a challenging concept to learn, but we can all reach this goal. To represent 16 in binary, you would need 5 bits.  It's representation is 10000.  
    :correct: c

    What's the largest number that can be represented in 4 bits?

    :answer_a: Trying to represent 15 in 4 bits. 
    :feedback_a: This is challenging, but rewarding! This would not cause an overflow.  15 is represented as 1111 in 4 bits. 
    :answer_b: Trying to represent 16 in 4 bits.
    :feedback_b: Yes.  The largest number that can be represented in 4 bits is 15, which is 1111.  To represent 16 you would need an additional <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bit</span>, 1 0000.
    :answer_c: Trying to represent 31 in 5 bits. 
    :feedback_c: This is challenging, but rewarding! This would not cause an overflow.  31 is represented as 1 1111 in 5 bits. 
    :answer_d: Trying to represent 32 in 5 bits 
    :feedback_d: Yes.  The largest number that can be represented in 5 bits is 31, which is 1 1111.  To represent 32 you would need a 6th <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bit</span>,  10 0000.
    :correct: b,d

    An overflow error occurs when there aren't enough bits to represent a given number.  
    Which of following would cause an overflow error to occur. (Choose all that apply.)

.. mchoice:: mcsp-2-9-3
    :random:
    :practice: T
    :answer_a: True.
    :feedback_a: Yes, to think of a simple example, if you were using 4 bits to represent numbers you wouldn't be able to represent the number 17, so you wouldn't be able to add 17 + 8.   Modern computers use 32 or 64 bits to represent whole numbers, which are called <i>integers</i>.  With 32 bits, you can represent 2<sup>32</sup> different values. That's 4,294,967,296, more than 4 billion values.  But, of course, there are still numbers that would cause overflow errors -- e.g., 4,300,000,000 could not be represented using 32 bits.  This potential for <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='overflow error'>overflow error</span> is a necessary implication of using a <i><b>finite</b></i> representation to model the <i><b>infinite</b></i> concept of number. 
    :answer_b: False
    :feedback_b: This is challenging, but rewarding! Using a fixed number of bits to represent numbers does limit the range of problems you can solve.  For example, if you were using 4 bits to represent numbers you wouldn't be able to represent the number 17, so you wouldn't be able to add 17 + 8.  Modern computers use 32 or 64 bits to represent whole numbers, which are called <i>integers</i>.  With 32 bits, you can represent 2<sup>32</sup> different values. That's 4,294,967,296, more than 4 billion values.  But, of course, there are still numbers that would cause overflow errors -- e.g., 4,300,000,000 could not be represented using 32 bits.  This potential for <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='overflow error'>overflow error</span> is a necessary implication of using a <i><b>finite</b></i> representation to model the <i><b>infinite</b></i> concept of number. 
    :correct: a

    True or False. Using a fixed number of bits to represent numbers limits the range of values and hence limits the range of problems that can be solved with that representation.

    Everything in a computer is represented with sequences of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bits</span>, 0’s and 1’s. There are some consequences of using of using <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bits</span> to represent data though. How do you think repeating decimal (real) numbers like 3.33333333… are stored in a computer’s memory? Would it fit in memory if it was an infinitely repeating decimal? Since the memory would not be able to hold an infinitely repeating number like this, computers round off repeating decimals after a fixed number of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bits</span> and only hold their approximate values in memory.  Even with integer numbers, the memory will limit the size of the integer. The fixed number of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bits</span> used to represent numbers limits the range of values and mathematical operations on those values, and can even cause errors such as overflow or rounding off errors. An <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='overflow error'>overflow error</span> occurs when a computer attempts to handle a number that is larger than the memory it has available. Even modern computers can occasionally have an <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='overflow error'>overflow error</span> when the computer attempts to handle a very large number that is outside of the defined range of values can be represented. In many programming languages, integer numbers are limited to a size of 4 bytes (32 <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bits</span> where each byte is 8 <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='bit'>bits</span>) in memory and real numbers with decimal points to 8 bytes. Languages like App Inventor and the AP pseudocode only limit the size of the data by the size of the computer’s memory.

    <!-- &lt;h1&gt;Hexadecimal Numbers&lt;/h1&gt;
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p&gt;One problem with binary  numbers is that it takes lots of digits to represent relatively small numbers. For example,  a number like 1 million would require 20 binary digits: 11110100001001000000. So, we often use the &lt;b&gt;hexadecimal (<span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='base'>base</span> 16)&lt;/b&gt; number system, which uses the digits 0-9 as well as the letters A-F to represent the decimal numbers 0-15. Each 4 binary bits can be replaced by 1 hex digit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <!--&lt;p&gt;In your portfolio, create a new page named &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Binary Numbers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; under the &lt;i&gt;Reflections&lt;/i&gt; category of your portfolio (we recommend also including the lesson number. Check with your instructor) and answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Figure out what decimal value is represented by the following binary number &lt;tt&gt;0011 1010 0011&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Represent the decimal value 517 as a binary number.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The binary number system is &lt;i&gt;base 2&lt;/i&gt; and has 2 digits.  The decimal number system is &lt;i&gt;base 10&lt;/i&gt; and has 10 digits.  The &lt;i&gt;octal
    system&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;base 8&lt;/i&gt;. How many digits does it have?  What are they, starting at 0?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Suppose the number 523 is a base-8 octal number. What would its value be in decimal?  In binary?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenging (optional):&lt;/b&gt; Convert the &lt;b&gt; base-5 &lt;/b&gt; number 243 into decimal.&lt;/li&gt;
