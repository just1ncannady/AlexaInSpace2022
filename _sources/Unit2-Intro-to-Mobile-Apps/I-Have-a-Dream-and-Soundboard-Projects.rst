Learning Activities
---------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <h3>Enhancing the I Have a Dream App</h3>
    <p>To get started, <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/" target="_blank">open App Inventor</a>
     in a separate tab and open your I Have a Dream app from the previous lesson.
      Complete the programming exercises described below and in the preview video.  Then, design your own sound board project below.
      
     </p><ol>
    <li>Give the app its own custom icon that will appear in the device's app launcher when the app is packaged (built). (Hint: Look in the <i>Screen</i>'s properties);</li>
    <li>Use App Inventor's <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/components/media.html#TextToSpeech" target="_blank">
         Text-to-Speech</a> component (Media drawer) to get the app to speak some words
         instead of playing a speech when the Malcolm X button is pressed.
       </li>
    <li>Have the app vibrate the phone as well as play a speech when the MLK button is
         pressed (Hint: the Sound component has a Vibrate block.  <font color="red">NOTE:</font> 
         Not all Android devices have a vibrate mode, which is usually a Sound setting.  
         For example, Nexus 7 tablets can not vibrate.)
       </li>
    <li>Use App Inventor's <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/components/sensors.html#AccelerometerSensor" target="_blank">
         Accelerometer Sensor</a> (Sensor drawer) to trigger Malcolm X's Text-to-Speech when the device is shaken. 
       </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Need some help with the Text-to-Speech and Accelerometer? Try watching <a href="http://www.appinventor.org/content/howDoYou/eventHandling/shaking" target="_blank">this video</a> and then debugging your code.</p>
    

	<h3>A Sound Board Project</h3>
    
    Use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q" target="_blank">Pair Programming</a> for this project. You and your partner will:
    <ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Create your own <i>Soundboard</i> app with at least three pictures and  three sound files that are played 
      when you click the pictures.  Make sure that your app doesn't allow the sounds to overlap each other.  That is,
      when you click a button to play a sound, the app should pause any sound that is already playing.  This will
      require the use of an <b>if/else</b> block.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><span class="yui-non">Create a one minute <b>narrated</b> video in .mp4, .wmv, .avi, or .mov format that demonstrates and explains  
        your app. The video must not exceed 1 minute in length and must not exceed 30MB in size. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-4oA9bdqDRse1nYpV2wxHnOIwFNas01TbeRnVSBKQ6I/view" target="_blank" title="">How To: Create an App Video</a> for help with creating a video.</span></li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Post your video on your portfolio.</li>
    <li>Reflect with your partner on how creating a computing innovation like this app was improved with collaboration. Post your reflection on your portfolio.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Optional:</b> Create your own icons, images, and sound files for your app using programs such as 
      Paint and Audacity.
    </p>
    <h3>Finding Copyright-free Image and Sound Files</h3>
    <p>Many sounds and images online are copyrighted and it is a <b><i>violation
      of copyright</i></b> to include such images in your app.  So, you should be
      careful about the images and sounds you put into your apps.  If you want to use
      a copyrighted image or sound in your app, you will have to get permission from 
      the holder of the copyright.  It might be easier just to search for free media.
    </p>
    <p>There are sites that offer free audio and image files, including the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <!--&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page&quot;&gt;Wikimedia commons&lt;/a&gt; is a great source of free and open source media.  Any files found on its sites can be used in apps without violating copyright.&lt;/li&gt;-->
    <li><a href="http://images.google.com" target="_blank">Google Image Search</a>: search for an image, then on the results page, select Tools. Under the Usage Rights drop-down, select Creative Commons Licenses.</li>
    <li><a href="http://soundbible.com/royalty-free-sounds-1.html" target="_blank">Sound Bible</a> (free sound files)</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/soundeffects" target="_blank">Youtube Sound Effects</a> (free sound files)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.freesound.org/">Freesound.org</a> (requires registration) </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.freesfx.co.uk/">Freesfx.co.uk</a> (requires registration)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Resizing Images and Sound Files</h3>
    <p>App Inventor apps have a <b>5 Mb size limit</b>.  Therefore not all images and
      sounds you upload will work in your app.  Here are some tools that can
      be used to resize images and sounds:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>On MacOS, the <i>Preview</i> application can be used to resize images.  Just
        open the image in Preview and use the <i>Tools</i> menu to resize it.
      </li>
    <li>On Windows machines, the <i>Paint</i> application can be used to resize
        images.  Just open the image and use the <i>Resize</i> tool.
      </li>
    <li>For editing sound files,  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">
        Audacity</a> is a free and open source sound file editor for all platforms.
      </li>
    <li>You can also downsize sound files using the free online web app <a href="http://cutmp3.net/" target="_blank">CutMp3.net</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="www.mp3cut.net">Another online web app you can use to cut your sound files is mp3cut.net</a>
    </li>
    <li>If your video mp4 file is too big, try uploading to a youtube channel and then click Manage to download as a much smaller mp4 file. </li>
    </ul>
