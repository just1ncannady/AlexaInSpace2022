    <h3>If/Else Selection Blocks</h3>
    <p>The <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/support/blocks/control.html#if" target="_blank">if block</a> in MIT App Inventor can be used to choose between different actions.  All programming languages have something like if blocks, called selection or conditional algorithms, to make decisions based on a condition. In this version of the app, we want to use the buttons to toggle playing and pausing the speeches. When a button is clicked, if that speech is already playing, we want to pause the speech. If it is paused, we want to start playing it again. To do this, we need to use an If block from the Control drawer of the block editor. This block has a blue mutator button where we can drag in an else block to make the block into an <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='If/Else'>If/Else</span> block which will allow us to choose between 2 actions (pause or play) depending on if the speech is already playing.</p><p>

Check with your instructor to see if they have additional worksheets or activities for you to complete.<br/><br/>With the expansion of computers and the Internet, every day new computing innovations are being developed. A <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Computing Innovation'>computing innovation</span> includes a program as an integral part of its <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program function">function</span>. The <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program purpose">purpose</span> of computing innovations is to solve problems or to pursue interests through creative expression. Understanding the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="program purpose">purpose</span> of a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Computing Innovation'>computing innovation</span> provides developers with an improved ability to develop that <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Computing Innovation'>computing innovation</span>.

      <div><img src="../_static/mcsp_Collaboration.jpg" width="260" style="float:right;margin-left:15px;margin-top:5px;">Computing innovations, such as the I Have a Dream mobile app, are often improved through collaboration. Most computing innovations are developed by groups or teams of developers. Effective collaboration can take many forms. It can range from working with a diverse group of people to create or modify the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Computing Innovation'>computing innovation</span> to consulting and communicating with users as part of the development process of the computing innovations (e.g. gathering information from potential users of your app to help understand the program from diverse perspectives). In the end, effective collaboration produces a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Computing Innovation'>computing innovation</span> that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it. Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives is important because it helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations. One model to help facilitate collaboration is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q" target="_blank">Pair Programming</a>. This course emphasizes collaboration, so there will be plenty of opportunities for pair programming when developing apps in the course. </div>

    :feedback_d: A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function.  A bar code itself does not contain a program - it is an image. 
    :correct: a,b,c

    A computing innovation includes a program as an integral part of its function. Which of the following would be considered computing innovations?    Choose all that apply.

    :answer_b: Clear
    :feedback_b: Mistakes are welcome here! Try reviewing this; this choice tells us what is happening, but it doesn't tell us what is making something clear. Therefore a better option would also tell us that it was a button. 
    :answer_c: ClearButton
    :feedback_c: Correct! 
    :answer_d: ButtonA
    :feedback_d: Mistakes are welcome here! Try reviewing this; it is best to give buttons names that help you understand their function.

Sample AP CSP Exam Question
----------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    In the sample AP exam below, <span style="font-style: italic;">absent </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">onTime</span> are variables that can be true or false, just like <i>Player1.IsPlaying </i>could be true or false in the if blocks in the I Have a Dream app. They are both false in this question. This question uses nested if blocks where a second if block is inside the else of the first if block. <br/>
.. mchoice:: mcsp-2-4-5
    :random:
    :practice: T
    :answer_a:  Is anyone there?
    :feedback_a: This would only display if absent was true, but absent is false.
    :answer_b:  Better late than never.
    :feedback_b: That's correct!
    :answer_c:  Hello. Is anyone there?
    :feedback_c: Hello would only display if onTime was true, but onTime is false.
    :answer_d:  Hello. Better late than never.
    :feedback_d: Hello would only display if onTime was true, but onTime is false.
    :correct: b

    Consider the code segment below.If the variables onTime and absent both have the value false, what is displayed as a result of running the code segment?
