Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>Computing has transformed our lives in so many ways. And mobile computing, where we are constantly connected to others and to the world via our mobile devices, is challenging us right now to come with new norms about privacy, security, the ownership or openness of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='data'>data</span> and information, and other issues.</p>
    <div class="yui-wk-div">
    <p>Like any technology, mobile computing has both positive and negative impacts. We need to reflect on these impacts in general and we also think about the impacts we will create as we build our own mobile apps.</p>    <table><tbody>

	<p><h3>Chapter One: The Digital Explosion—Why Is It Happening and What Is At Stake?</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/B2B_3.pdf#page=19" target="_blank">Chapter One of Blown to Bits</a> makes the point that today everything is digital -- that is, everything is represented by binary digits or bits. And it provides some provocative examples of the societal implications of this digital explosion.</p>
    <p>Take a look around your classroom or room. Where can you see devices that use bits? Try to think beyond just your computers and mobile phones or tablets. For example, is the room's lightswitch on a timer or have a motion sensor? Here are <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rY94EKJPiqiGXd3XR2KIw8dSkz3psOFNADcI0JSR1wU" target="_blank">some examples</a> you can use to help you get started.</p>
    <br/>
  
    <p>
    <p><b>Part 1:</b>
    </p><ol>
    <li>Read pages 1-4 in Chapter One and Koan 4 about <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Moore’s Law'>Moore's law</span> on pages 8-9 to learn more about how quickly our world has become digital. As you read, use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zJ__6P0CvtL2CGAFzHF7T4tc6hRAkmhZPvGu7gdl_4o/copy" target="_blank">Double Entry Journal</a> (File -- Make a copy for an editable version) to summarize and comment on at least four quotes or summarized ideas that the authors bring forward in this chapter. Discuss your quotes with your classmates.</li>
    <li>Watch the short video of Moore at the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/moores-law-technology.html" target="_blank">Intel website</a>.
        </li><li>Below is an image that represents <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Moore’s Law'>Moore's law</span> graphically - the observation that the number of transistors per square inch on integrated circuits had doubled every two years since their invention. This means the speed at which we can process digital <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='data'>data</span> increases exponentially. Discuss the graphic with your class.</li>
    </ol><br/>
    <img alt="Moore's Law Graph" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/2/1640/25046013104_68059057ab_b.jpg" width="500px"/>
    <p><b>Part 2:</b> Over the next 24 hours, keep track of all the technology that you use with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t108otAa9_MFtFERsozLL0g-UXQkdAKfKotZgIhGCg0/edit?ts=5f6dfd20#" target="_blank" title="">this worksheet</a>. For example, do you use your phone to set an alarm? Does your coffee maker include a mini-computer? Keep a running list of items that you use and then make a tally or count how often you use them during the day. Once you're done, consider how easy or difficult it would be to make it through a single day without using a computer. Which of your daily activities could you do without digital information or devices?</p>
    <p><b>Part 3:</b> Read pages 13-16 (Good and Ill, Promise and Peril) in Chapter One which takes a look at the positive and negative implications of the digital explosion. This is an important concept as part of the AP exam multiple choice questions. Get into groups of 4 and use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g5fuVEDu3V2XHVRBok1gFAOaAV7eWyict1S2ROopsw0" target="_blank">Debate Team Carousel</a> handout to discuss this concept further.</p>

    <!--&lt;h2&gt;Homework: For Your Portfolio&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Create a page called &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blown to Bits Chapter 1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; under the &lt;i&gt;Homework&lt;/i&gt; category of your Portfolio (If you are using the Mobile CSP Student portfolio template, this page has already been created for you) and post brief answers using complete sentences to  the following questions on that page.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;What is a &lt;i&gt;bit&lt;/i&gt; and what does it mean to say that &quot;it&#39;s all just bits&quot;? (Koan 1) Give examples of two things today that are stored as bits.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;!--
        &lt;li&gt;Describe Moore&#39;s Law in your own words.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Someone offers you a summer job and offers you two pay rates: (1) $10 per hour for 40 hours per week for 30 days or (2) One cent on day 1, two cents and day two, four cents on day three and on (doubling each day) for 30 days. If you were trying to make as much money as possible in 30 days, which pay rate would you choose? What does this illustrate?&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Give an example of how the digital explosion is &quot;neither good nor bad&quot; but has both positive and negative implications.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Find and summarize a news article that talks about the positive or negative impacts of a computing innovation. Is the technology itself positive or negative? Or have people used the technology in positive and/or negative ways?&lt;/li&gt;
