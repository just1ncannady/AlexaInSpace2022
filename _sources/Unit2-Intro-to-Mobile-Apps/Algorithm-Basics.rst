Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p>
    <p>In <a href="https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/mobilecsp/Unit1-Getting-Started/Mazes-Algorithms-and-Programs.html" target="_blank">Lesson 1.2</a> 
      we introduced the term <b><i><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span></i></b> and defined it as a <u>step-by-step procedure</u> of <u>precise instructions</u>
      that performs some calculation or computation.
    Algorithms are at the heart of computer science. Algorithms, expressed in computer code 
      and interpreted by the computer, are what make our computers such powerful and adaptable machines. Beyond visual and textual programming languages, algorithms can be expressed in a variety of ways such as natural language, diagrams, and <b><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='pseudocode'>pseudocode</span></b> which is a way to describe the each step of the code in English to plan it out. 
    Algorithms can be created from an idea, by combining existing algorithms, or by modifying existing algorithms. 
    Knowledge of existing algorithms can help in constructing new ones. Using existing correct algorithms as building blocks for constructing another <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> has benefits such as reducing development time, reducing testing, and simplifying the identification of errors.
    </p>
    <p>As we saw in the maze problems in Lesson 1.2, algorithms are constructed out of basic building 
      blocks called <i>control structures</i>.  There are three basic control structures:
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li><b><i><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Sequence'>Sequence</span></i></b>– a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span> of instructions or statements.</li>
    <li><b><i><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Selection'>Selection</span></i></b>– a conditional instruction that lets the program branch between two or more alternatives.</li>
    <li><b><i><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Repetition'>Repetition</span> (or <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Iteration'>Iteration</span>)</i></b>– a structure that repeats one or more instructions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An amazing fact that has been proved by computer scientists is that all algorithms can be 
      constructed by using just these three control structures.  In other words, any <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> that you 
      would like to write to solve a problem can be built by a combination of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span>, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='selection'>selection</span>, and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='repetition'>repetition</span>.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <div><b>Learning Objectives:</b>&nbspI will learn to</div>
    <ul>
    <li>express an <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> that uses <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequencing</span>, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='selection'>selection</span> and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='iteration'>iteration</span> without using a programming language</li>
    <li>create algorithms, write conditional statements, write iteration statements</li>
    </ul>
    <div><b>Language Objectives:</b>&nbspI will be able to</div>
    <ul>
    <li>use target vocabulary, such as <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span>, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span>, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='selection'>selection</span>, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='repetition'>repetition</span>, and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='pseudocode'>pseudocode</span>, while describing a problem solving process, out loud and in writing, with the support of <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n-K4AQ_maHcXekzcfERQ9dxj91nqv9ytwJx4ZkAp8zw/copy" target="_blank" title="">vocabulary notes</a> from this lesson</li>

    <h3>Algorithms: Solving a Maze</h3>
    <p>The problem below is similar to a type of AP CSP exam question. Consider a robot that can follow the simple <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span> commands below:
     </p><ul>
    <li> <b>MOVE_FORWARD</b> : The robot moves 1 square forward in the direction it is facing.
      </li><li> <b> ROTATE_RIGHT </b>: The robot turns right 90 degrees, staying in the same square but facing right.
      </li><li><b> ROTATE_LEFT</b> : The robot turns left 90 degrees, staying in the same square but facing left.
      </li><li><b> CAN_MOVE( <em>direction</em> )</b> : This command can be used with 4 possible directions: <b>left, right, forward,</b> and <b>backward</b>. It returns true if there is an open square in the specified direction from the square that the robot is in. 
    </li></ul>
    <br/>Let's put our robot in the maze below. The robot is represented as a black triangle and is initially facing up. It can only move forward to a white square. It cannot move onto the black squares or move beyond the edge of the grid.  <br/>
      <img src="../_static/assets/img/Q18SquareQuestion.png" width="20%"/>
    <p>Answer the following questions with your POGIL group using <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_TAwm91lPJjIzwmAxNvbWqZNnNGzQuwx4YEt2TlWaQ/copy" target="_blank">this worksheet</a>:
      </p><ol>
    <li>For the robot in the maze above, is CAN_MOVE(forward) true? Is CAN_MOVE(right) true?
         </li><li>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Portfolio</span>) Write an <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> using the 4 commands above to navigate the robot through the maze to reach the gray square. You can pretend that one of you is the robot and walk through your <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> with your fingers on the maze. Are there commands that are repeated in your <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span>? Circle them.
        </li><li>(<span style="font-weight: bold;">Portfolio</span>) Let's replace the repeated commands with a <b><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='repetition'>repetition</span></b> <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='control structure'>control structure</span>. The following command can be used to repeat a block of commands:
    <div class="yui-wk-div" id="apml">
    <bl class="dark">REPEAT n times<br/>
       <bl>commands</bl></bl>
    </div>
    <br/>Rewrite your <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> above using <em>Repeat n times</em> control structures (substituting in a number for n) instead of repeating the MOVE_FORWARD command many times. 
        </li><li>Can you come up with a more general <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> to navigate a maze using <b>IF</b> commands and  a <b>REPEAT UNTIL GoalReached</b> command, which tests if the robot has reached the gray square goal?

    <p>
    <p>It may seem a bit amazing to you that the three simple control structures we used in the Maze problems are powerful enough, in combination, to build any algorithm that can be thought of. But this fact, known as the <i>structured program theorem</i>, was proved in a 1966 research paper by Corrado Boehm and Guiseppe Jacopini. You can read more about it in this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_program_theorem">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>

    :answer_b: Algorithms can be written to solve every problem. 
    :feedback_b: Yes, by process of elimation, this is the correct answer.  As we will learn more fully later in the course, it has been proved that there are problems for which it is impossible to write a correct algorithm.  Such problems are called <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem">undecidable problems</a>.  A surpisingly simple example is the <i>halting problem</i>,  which can be stated as:  Given a description of an arbitrary computer program and a finite set of inputs to the program, determine whether the program will eventually stop or run forever.
    :answer_c: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures.
    :feedback_c: This is challenging, but rewarding! Algorithms do proceed step-by-step.  So this is not the correct answer.
    :answer_d: Algorithms consist of a combination of sequences, selections, and/or repetitions. 
    :feedback_d: This is challenging, but rewarding! Algorithms are indeed constructed by combinations of three control structures,  sequence, selection, and repetition.  So this is not the correct answer.

    <!--&lt;p&gt;Create a page named&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Algorithm Basics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; under the &lt;i&gt;Reflections&lt;/i&gt; category of your portfolio and answer the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL&lt;/b&gt;)  Write an algorithm using the 4 simple commands  to navigate the robot through the maze in the POGIL question above. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL&lt;/b&gt;) Write an algorithm using repetition control structures  to navigate the robot through the maze in the POGIL question above.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL&lt;/b&gt;) Include a description or a photo of your drawing of a maze that the general algorithm in the POGIL exercise cannot solve.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL&lt;/b&gt;) Write an algorithm  for washing a stack of 10 items that are cups and dishes mixed together, where the rule is that cups are washed in hot water and dishes in cold water. Use simple commands like &lt;b&gt;hot_wash&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;cold_wash&lt;/b&gt;. You may also use the control structures &lt;b&gt;IF&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;REPEAT n times&lt;/b&gt;. Identify the parts of your algorithm that are examples  of &lt;i&gt;Sequence, Selection,&lt;/i&gt; and     &lt;i&gt;Repetition&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;-->
