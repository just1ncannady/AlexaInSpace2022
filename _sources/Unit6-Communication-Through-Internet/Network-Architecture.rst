Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p></p>
	As we've learned in previous lessons, the Internet is a network of networks that is managed by a collection of protocols.  We've already seen the role that the HTTP protocol plays in supporting the World Wide Web application.  In this lesson we delve more deeply into the basic architecture and infrastructure of the Internet.  We'll learn that the main Internet protocols are organized into a hierarchy of abstraction layers -- the application, transport, internet, and link layers -- each of which manages certain specific tasks required to route messages between <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="host">hosts</span> on the Internet. We'll learn about
	<ul>
    <li>Internet architecture and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='abstraction layer'>abstraction layers</span></li>
    <li>The <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='packet switching'>packet switching</span> routing scheme</li>
    <li>The TCP/IP protocol</li>
    </ul>
	<p>
      After this lesson you should have a pretty good understanding of how some of your familiar applications -- web browsing,
      email, smartphone apps -- are supported by the underlying Internet hardware and software. Here is a short video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewrBalT_eBM" target="_blank">A Packet's Tale</a> to get us started on our journey.
    </p>
	<div><b>Learning Objectives:</b>&nbspI will learn to</div>
	<ul>
	<li>explain how data are sent through the Internet via <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="packet">packets</span></li>
	<li>identify and describe the benefits of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="fault-tolerant">fault-tolerant networks</span></li>
	</ul>

Learning Activities
--------------------

.. raw:: html

    <p><h3>Part 1: Network Architecture and Packet Switching</h3>
    <p>
      This first video focuses on basic architecture of the Internet and the technique of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='packet'>packet</span> switching. 
     The Internet has been engineered to be <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='fault-tolerant'>fault-tolerant</span>, which means it can support failures and still continue to function. Network <b>redundancy</b> allows having more than one path between any two connected devices in case something part of the network fails. If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route, if possible.  Redundancy within a system often requires additional resources but can provide the benefit of fault tolerance. The redundancy of routing options between two points increases the reliability of the Internet and helps it scale to more devices and more people.  The Internet was designed to be scalable. The <b>scalability</b> of a system is the capacity for the system to change in size and scale to meet new demands. 
      
      </p><p>The video also illustrates how the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='ping'>ping</span>
      utility can be used to test whether certain <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id="host">hosts</span> are reachable on the network.  And it introduces a new 
      tool, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='traceroute'>traceroute</span>, that can be used to trace the routes that packets take from one computer to 
      another on the Internet. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1g7NmzbMvyBYLZwe2NtWXSurW4D7o-uCKYCdI2yvDFIc" target="_blank" title="">Slides</a>)</p>

      In this activity, 
      you will use the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='ping'>ping</span> and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='traceroute'>traceroute</span> utilities at <a href="http://network-tools.com/" target="_blank">network-tools.com</a> to measure the latency and observe trace routes to answer the following question.
      </p><blockquote>
    <b>Does geographical distance between the source and the destination 
          on the network affect latency?
        </b>
    </blockquote>
    <p>You will use multiple trials of <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='ping'>ping</span> and trace for 5 university servers around the globe (mit.edu, stanford.edu, ox.ac.uk, kyoto-u.ac.jp, usp.br) to answer the questions below.</p>
	<ol>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Did any of the servers lose packets or time out?  Some servers will block <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='ping'>ping</span> and trace for security reasons which are seen as time outs. Were there any surprising locations in the hops that the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='packet'>packet</span> went through?</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Did different trials have different results for the same destination? Do packets always get routed in the same way?</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Can you guess where the network-tools server is located based on the latency data you collected? Can you confirm your guess using trace or whois (which gives you information about who owns a server)? </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Select one route and specify all the directly-connected computing devices along the route which form a path between the sender and the receiver. How many hops are taken on this path? List each device on this path.</li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 5px;">How does the number of hops in the trace affect latency (the round trip time seen in <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='ping'>ping</span>)?  </li>
    <li> (<b>Portfolio</b>) How does geographical distance affect latency? What are some other factors that may be affecting latency? </li>
    </ol><br/>
    </div>
    <h3>Part 2: Internet Abstraction Layers</h3>
    <p>
     Data is sent through the Internet in data streams made up of data packets.  Each <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='packet'>packet</span> contains data and metadata used for routing the <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='packet'>packet</span> between the origin and the destination on the Internet, as well as for data reassembly. This video focuses on the TCP/IP model which is a set of abstraction layers with different protocols that manage the routing of messages on the Internet. Protocols such as TCP, IP, UDP, and SMTP work together in the hierarchy to support applications such as email and web browsing.

      How does the geographical distance between the source and destination hosts on a network affect latency? 
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What are the benefits of packet switching?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL Activity 2&lt;/b&gt;)  &lt;b&gt;Missing Packets.&lt;/b&gt; What should happen if a packet goes missing? Who (which layer) would handle this?  What action would they have to take?  And what additional information would be needed in the packet in order to handle it?  &lt;/li&gt;
    
      &lt;li&gt;(&lt;b&gt;POGIL Activity 2&lt;/b&gt;) &lt;b&gt;Security/Privacy.&lt;/b&gt;  As the packets are being transmitted through the network, can people other than the sender and receiver read the messages? What methods can we use to protect the message?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
    
      &lt;/ol&gt;-->
