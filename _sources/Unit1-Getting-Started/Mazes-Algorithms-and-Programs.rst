Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

	<p>
    <h3>Let's do some programming</h3>
    <p>MIT App Inventor  is based on a blocks platform named 
    <a href="https://blockly-demo.appspot.com/static/apps/index.html" target="_blank">Blockly</a>.  This demo
      is from <a href="http://code.org" target="_blank">Code.org</a>'s Hour of Code activity -- maybe you've 
      seen it before?   It will help you get a sense of the type of programming you will be doing in this course.  
      It lets you write small Blockly programs (called <i>scripts</i>) to solve Maze puzzles.  Can you solve all
      20 problems?

Learning Activities
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

    <h3>Algorithms and Programs</h3>
    <p>As you learned in that activity, an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm" target="_blank"><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Algorithm'>Algorithm</span><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span></a> 
      is a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span> of precise instructions that solves some problem or performs some computation.   
      A <i>program</i> is an <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> that is written in a programming language that runs on a computer and is often referred to as <i>software</i>.  A program can be described by what it does and how the program statements accomplish its function.
      Each of the levels in the previous activity contained <i>code segments</i> which are collections of program statements that are part of a program. 
    
    </p><p>The scripts you created in the Maze demo contain all the essential <i><b>control
    structures</b></i> that programmers use to design algorithms:
    </p><ul>
    <li><b><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Sequence'>Sequence</span></b>.  An <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> is a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span> of precise statements (blocks).
    </li><li><b><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Selection'>Selection</span> (if/else)</b>. An <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> can select between two alternative
    paths based on some condition.
    </li><li><b><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Repetition'>Repetition</span> or <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='Iteration'>Iteration</span> (repeat)</b>. An <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> can repeat a <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span> of statements.
    </li></ul>
    <h3>Algorithms are Everywhere</h3> 
    
    Now that you've been introduced to the term <i><span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span></i> and have an initial idea of what it means, you're 
    going to discover algorithms everywhere. As you've grown up, you've learned all sorts of
    algorithms to solve everyday problems.  For example, certainly we all know how to tie our shoelaces. But can you 
    tie your shoelace in 2 seconds?   You could if you follow this <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span>:

    <p>Here's an interesting fact:  Computer scientists have 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_program_theorem" target="_blank">proved</a> that <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span>, 
    <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='selection'>selection</span>, and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='repetition'>repetition</span> are sufficient to 
    build any <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> that can be thought of.  In other words, any <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> 
    can be expressed using only <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span>, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='selection'>selection</span>, and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='repetition'>repetition</span>. 
    
    </p><h3>Food for Thought</h3>
    <p>Computer scientists write algorithms to solve problems. 
    And we know now that <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='sequence'>sequence</span>, <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='selection'>selection</span>, and <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='repetition'>repetition</span> are sufficient to 
    express any <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span> we can think of.  
    
    </p><p>Are there algorithms we <i>can't</i> think of?  Or, to put that another
    way, are there problems that can't be solved by an <span class="hover vocab yui-wk-div" data-id='algorithm'>algorithm</span>?   What do you
    think?
    
    </p><p>That's one of the interesting questions we will take up in this course. In a few weeks, you'll know the answer.
