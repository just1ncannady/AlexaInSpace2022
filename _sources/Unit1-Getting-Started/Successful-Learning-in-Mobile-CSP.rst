     <h3 id="est-length">Time Estimate: 45 minutes</h3>

Introduction and Goals
-----------------------

.. raw:: html

     <p style="text-align:center"><i>You may not have thought of yourself as a computer scientist before, but,</i><br>
     just like most people can run but may not be runners,<br>
     or can sing but may not be singers,<br>
     <b>YOU can learn computer science!</b></p>

     <p>This course will be hard at times, but that's okay. It means that you have an 
     <i>opportunity to learn</i> and to stretch your brain.</p>
     <p>Your programs may not work on the first try, but that's okay. It just means that you have an opportunity to learn how to write it correctly the next time.</p>

     <h3>What to Say to Yourself: Growth Mindset</h3>
     
     <p>Sometimes we use words that are not of a growth mindset. If you find yourself saying or thinking what's in the left column, try substituting what's in the right column. 
     <style>    td { text-align: left; padding: 5px;}</style>
     <table border>
       <thead><tr><th>Instead of: </th><th>Try Thinking/Saying:</th></tr></thead>
       <tbody><tr>
     <td>
     I&rsquo;m not good at this.
     </td>
     <td>
     What am I missing?

     <h3>Strategies for Being a Successful Learner</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>Review the exercises at the end of each lesson multiple times. If you get it wrong the first time, then review the lesson again.
       </li><li>If you're struggling with a program, ask your neighbor or work in pairs. Two sets of eyes are better than one!
       </li><li>Ask questions! If you're confused, it's likely someone else in the class may be confused, too.
       </li><li>If something seems easy, look for Challenge exercises or the Still Curious? sections in the lesson to stretch your brain.
         </li><li>Focus on learning <i>concepts</i> rather than getting a good grade. When you have to write your own app or take a test, it will help you more if you're confident that you deeply understand the concepts.
       </li>
       <li>Test yourself often - make flashcards for vocabulary, build apps without watching the solutions video or reading the solutions text, go back to previous lessons and complete the interactive exercises again, etc.
     </ul>
