     <h3>Google Account</h3>

     <p>In order to 
     build apps with App Inventor you will need a Gmail account. If you don't already have an 
     account <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp" target="_blank">
     visit the Google Signup Form</a> and  follow the instructions there for setting up 
     an account.<p></p> 

     <h3>Your Mobile CSP Portfolio</h3>

     <p>We encourage you to keep a Mobile CSP Portfolio of your work. This could be a folder of documents perhaps on Google drive or on Google Classroom or a Google website.  The portfolio is a good place to share ideas and to 
     present our apps and other work, also known as&nbsp;<i><b>computational artifacts</b></i>.  For each app that you build you will be asked to
     create a document or web page that describes your app and gives visitors links to download and
     run your app.  For non-programming lessons you will be asked to answer questions
     about a reading or to share your reflections about a contemporary issue such as "Privacy".

     </p><p>By the end of this course you will be very skilled at creating and maintaining
     your own portfolio. 
     Your portfolio will be one way to express yourself, be creative, and "Show your stuff!"</p>

     <h3>Google Classroom and Google Drive</h3>

     <p>If your school uses Google Classroom, your teacher may ask you to post your portfolio question documents and projects on Google Classroom instead of creating a Google Sites Portfolio. You can make your own copy of the Google documents following the links in the Portfolio Reflection Questions section at the end of each lesson.
     
     <h3>Google Sites Portfolio</h3>

     <p>If your teacher asks you to create a Google Sites portfolio, follow the directions below. To get started watch and follow the video or follow the written steps below:<br><br>
